# Reader Sampling (WIP)

Inspired by [Typical Sampling](https://t.co/QTfbH3D9Dh) this technique attempts to sample from a language model to maximize information transfer from a Writer to a Reader.

Both Writer and Reader are language models with some information disparity be it finetuning or a prompt.

I've also made a helpful class to make plotting Transformer predictions easier.
